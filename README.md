# **About the project:**
This project is a simple implementation of the advection model (without a diffusion term) in a randomly generated 2-dimensional carrier vector field. A simple but quite stable [Upwind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upwind_scheme) scheme was used to integrate the equation. The carrier vector field was generated by determining the rotation from a 2-dimensional scalar field which was an image of Super Simplex noise. Details of the method can be found in [this publication](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rbridson/docs/bridson-siggraph2007-curlnoise.pdf).

# **Jump start:**
The '**bin**' directory contains precompiled programs (for Windows x86-64 and Linux x86-64 architectures). The program uses .json configuration files, to perform a complete invocation of the sample simulation use: '**./fluid_simulation config.json**'. The included '**config.json**' configuration file contains the following keys (all keys are required):

#### '**config.json**'
```json
{
    "mass_distr_file_path": "mass_distr/mass.bmp",
    "output_directory_path": "frames",
    "frames_number": 1000,
    "simulation_factor": 8,
    "target_resolution": 1080,
    "flow_field_scale": 300.0,
    "dynamize_flow_field": true,
    "randomize_flow_field": true
}
```

- **mass_distr_file_path** - path to the graphic file with the initial mass distribution (popular graphic formats such as .bmp, .png, .jpeg ... are supported),
- **output_directory_path** - path to the folder for the result files (simulation frames will be saved in .png format),
- **frames_number** - number of frames generated,
- **simulation_factor** - simulation speed multiplier,
- **target_resolution** - target resolution of generated frames (supported resolutions: 480, 720, 1080, 1440, 2160),
- **flow_field_scale** - scaling of the vector field (to obtain a "dense" vector field (with a large number of small vortices), reduce this parameter),
- **dynamize_flow_field** - randomization of the vector field during simulation (simulation might be quite slow in this mode),
- **randomize_flow_field** - randomization of the initial state of the vector field
